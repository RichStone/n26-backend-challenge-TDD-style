# N26 Backend Challenge

This module was written in a TDD style as described
in 'Test-Driven-Development by Example' by Kent Beck.

The test classes are to be found inside the module because this code was
part of a challenge on hackerrank.com where multiple files are disallowed.

Task:
    1. Read a log file with HTTP responses
    2. Perform some filtering
    3. Create a new file with the filter results

Conditions:
    - duplicate lines are disallowed
    - a single log file might contain up to 2 * 10^5 lines which
      will add up to roughly 25 MB [ 200.000 * 120 / (1024 * 1024) ]


# Installation

If you have downloaded the repo, simply run:

    $ python3 filter_responses.py

And provide 'sample_input_file.txt' for the console prompt


# Usage

The ResponseFilter class filters a very specific log file format.

The TextFileFilter class provides a reusable method for removing duplicate lines.
